## 6. Summary

The Certificate Management Tool (CMT) project follows a structured and methodical approach to ensure timely delivery of a high-quality, production-ready solution. The detailed work breakdown structure, comprehensive activity list, and clear resource assignments provide transparency and accountability throughout the development lifecycle.

The project timeline spans approximately 20 weeks, from initial requirements gathering in early September 2024 to production deployment and training completion by late January 2025. The schedule incorporates realistic task durations, sequential dependencies, and parallel development streams to optimize resource utilization while maintaining quality standards.

Key milestones serve as critical checkpoints, ensuring that technical, security, and operational requirements are met before progressing to subsequent phases. The phased approach—from requirements and design through development, testing, and deployment—follows industry best practices and reduces project risk.

The involvement of multiple stakeholders, including the lead developer (Marco Domínguez), network engineering team, QA/test engineers, operations (NOC), and IT security team, ensures comprehensive coverage of functional, technical, and security requirements. Regular collaboration and communication mechanisms embedded within the schedule facilitate knowledge sharing and timely issue resolution.

Post-deployment activities, including training, monitoring, and continuous improvement, demonstrate a commitment to long-term success and user satisfaction. The structured planning and execution framework outlined in this document positions the CMT project to deliver significant value to the organization by automating certificate lifecycle management, reducing manual effort, minimizing security risks, and improving operational efficiency.

This schedule serves as a living document that will be reviewed and updated throughout the project lifecycle to reflect actual progress, accommodate changes, and ensure alignment with evolving organizational priorities and technical requirements.
